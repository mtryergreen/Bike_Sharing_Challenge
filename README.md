# Summary
Creating a pitch-worthy Tableau Story of NYC's CitiBike data, focusing on bike use duration per gender and date/time. 

Amongst the first pieces of data I inspected had to do with ride starting locations and ride stopping locations:

To convince angel investors in Des Moines that a bike-sharing business would be successful, I needed to create effective visualizations that communicate how effective and in-demand bike-sharing services are. 

## Results
I created 5 visualizations to communicate the CitiBike data. 

A visualization of Trip Duration shows that most trips are 10-15 minutes, with very few lasting more than 20 minutes. This means bikers are taking short rides around the city.

Checkout Times by gender demonstrates that males checkout bikes the most, and both males and females checkout bikes early in the day.

The heaviest bike usage is on Thursday evening, 5-6pm. Monday and Tuesday evenings are also high on the list of most popular checkout times.

Males and females use bikes around the same times each day, but males have heavier usage.

Males also have more trips, with female subscribers having the second most trips.

## Conclusion
The results show that members of a bike-share service are likely to be frequent customers, especially if the bike locations allow them to expedite the short trips they make every day (home -> work, work -> shops). 
To truly determine if this business will be successful outside of New York City, it would be ideal to collect data on why these bike riders made the trips they did: a joyride, commute to work, or stop to a local grocery store. With this data, we could better judge what locations would be most practical for future bike start and stop stations. 
Furthermore, it would be useful to know whether each usage is a unique or regular customer- someone who is using the Citibike for the first time, or someone who uses it daily/weekly/monthly. With this info, we would have a better understanding of who Citibike's core customers are: tourists looking for a ride, or locals needing a quick and practical commute.
